## How to use FrameSearch NOW!
1. Make a bookmark with the following value as the link:
```
javascript:(function(){document.body.innerHTML+='<iframe src="https://odddevelopment.github.io/FrameSearch/ui/" style="width:100%;height:100%;position:fixed;top:0;left:0;z-index:999999;background:#FFF;border:none;"></iframe>'})();
